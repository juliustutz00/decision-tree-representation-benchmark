1. Clone the repository
2. Install requirements
3. Navigate to repository root
4. run python examples/run_example.py

Note: there are multiple parameters that heavily influence runtime; adjust those accordingly to your needs
- src/benchmark_utils.py (line 26): max_depth=10 (higher depths can easily lead to very long runtimes and huge memory requirements (because INDTree's performance and memory usage scales with the max_depth of any tree it tries to learn))
- src/representations/indtree_representation.py (line 115): batch_size=1024 (adjust based on your hardware)
- src/representations/indtree_representation.py (line 119): max_epochs=10 (the authors suggest 2000; for this task, 10 might be enough)
- src/benchmark_runs.yaml (lines 5-6): representation_benchmark:true AND subforest_selection:true (only what what you need)
- src/benchmark_runs.yaml (line 10): n_splits:3 (number of cross-validation folds multiplies time needed)
- src/benchmark_runs.yaml (line 27): random_forest_size:300 (increasing number of decision trees in random forest drastically increases runtime and memory requirements)
- src/benchmark_runs.yaml (lines 25-26): intensities:[0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8,1] AND perturbation_runs:1 (perturbation experiment has to deal with random_forest_size*|intensities|*|perturbations|*|perturbation_runs| trees)
